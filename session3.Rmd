# Getting started with data in R

In this course, we'll be mostly focusing on a set of R packages specifically
designed for the most useful and common operations for interacting with and
visualizing data, and particularly data in a tabular form. This collection of
packages is known as the **tidyverse**.

Learning the **tidyverse** is more than just learning about some helpful
functions to get certain tasks done. The tidyverse packages form a coherant
system for data manipulation, exploration and visualization that share a common
design philosophy. There is a certain elegance to code crafted using the
tidyverse approach that is in stark contrast to the strange and often cryptic
equivalent using traditional 'base R'.

We will also start to look at the most important data structure you'll use
with your data, assuming it is in tabular form, the **data frame**, and its
superior tidyverse derivative, the **tibble**.

# Packages

Before we move on to the tidyverse version of a data frame, the tibble, we have
to load the tidyverse package that provides the tibble functionality. It doesn't
come with the set of packages loaded when you first start R.

There are thousands of R packages that extend R's core functionality to provide
specialized functions for doing all kinds of things. There are R packages that
provide various kinds of visualizations and plotting functions, others that let
us manipulate data in interesting and useful ways, and still others that give us
access to cutting-edge machine learning algorithms.

You need to load a package using the **`library()`** function in order to be
able to use the functions and data sets that the package provides. The tibble
data structure is part of the **`tibble`** package so to make this available you
would run the following command:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tibble)
```

The `tibble` package also contains various useful functions for converting other
data structures, e.g. data frames, to tibbles and for working with tibble
objects.

The `tibble` package is one of a collection of packages that make up the
tidyverse. It is usually more convenient to load the core tidyverse packages
in one go as follows.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

The output from this command tells us which packages were loaded, one of which
is the `tibble` package. Another of these is `ggplot2` that provides excellent
plotting functions for visualizing our data and will be the main focus next
week.

We also got a warning about some conflicts. This tells us that there are
functions loaded as part of the `dplyr` package that have the same name as
functions that are in the `stats` package. The `stats` package was already
loaded, from when we first started our R session, and the functions referred to
in the warning are now masked; to use these instead of their `dplyr` namesakes
you need to specify them fully by adding the package name and `::` as shown in
the warning message.

## Installing packages

If you got the following error message when trying to load the tidyverse, then
you haven't yet installed it.

```
> library(tidyverse)
Error in library(tidyverse) : there is no package called ‘tidyverse’
```

Installing packages should be relatively straightforward using the
`install.packages()` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If you're using R at a regular console within a terminal window, i.e. not
RStudio, you may be asked to select one of several mirrors of the CRAN R package
repository hosted at different locations around the world (in the UK these are
in Bristol and London).

For some packages you may be asked to choose between a binary and a source
package, particularly if the latest version of the package is only available in
source form and that package contains code written in another language such as
C. This could be a problem if you don't have a C compiler installed on your
computer - generally just choose to install the binary version.

# Tibbles

The tidyverse brings us a special type of data frame called the **`tibble`**.

Data frames have some rather quirky and annoying behaviours and the `tibble`
addresses some of these issues to make life a little easier. We'll first look at
how we can create a tibble and then will have a quick look at some of the
advantages of the tibble over the data frame.

## Creating a tibble

Tibbles can be created using the `tibble()` function in a similar manner to how
we created a data frame earlier.

```{r}
beatles <- tibble(
    name = c("John", "Paul", "Ringo", "George"),
    birth_year = c(1940, 1942, 1940, 1943),
    instrument = c("guitar", "bass", "drums", "guitar")
)
beatles
```

A data frame can be converted into a tibble using the `as_tibble()` function.

```{r}
irisTibble <- as_tibble(iris)
```

Our iris tibble is still a data frame but it also has acquired some additional
types or classes (`tbl_df` and `tbl`).

```{r}
class(iris)
class(irisTibble)
```

## Tibbles vs data frames

So let's now have a look at what capabilities and behaviours these additional
types confer and what the main differences are between tibbles and data frames.

The first immediate difference from a `data.frame` is that a `tibble` displays
the data type of each column under its name and it only prints as many columns
as fit on one screen. Another difference is that printing a `tibble` will not
print the whole dataset, but just the first 10 rows and only the columns that
fit the screen (same as `head` but with 10 rows instead of 6). If you would
like to print more than the first 10 rows use the `print` function.

Since printing `tibble` already gives you information about the data structure,
the data types of each column and the size of the dataset, the `str` function is
not as much useful as it was when using `data.frame`.

```{r, results=TRUE}
str(irisTibble)
```

Notice that rather than specifing `tibble` as the data structure of surveys,
the first line of `str`'s output now specifies ‘tbl_df’, ‘tbl’
and 'data.frame' which can be a bit confusing. These are the classes `tibble`
inherts from which in simple terms means that `tibble` is a `data.frame` with a
few modifications.  Therefore, most of the functions that were used with
`data.frame` can also be used with `tibble`.

# Reading data into R

Another of the tidyverse packages loaded when we ran `library(tidyverse)` is the
`readr` package, which provides functions for reading tabular data into a tibble
and writing tibbles to tab-delmited and comma-separated value (CSV) files.

For example, the clinical data for the METABRIC breast cancer dataset generated
at CRUK CI can be downloaded as a tab-delimited file from
[cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/clinicalData?id=brca_metabric).
Targeted sequencing was performed for 2509 primary breast tumours, along with
548 matched normals, using a panel of 173 of the most frequently mutated breast
cancer genes as part of the METABRIC study
([Pereira *et al.*, Nature Communications 7:11479, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27161491)).

There should be two metabric files in the **data** directory inside the
**R_Intro** directory. We are first going to load
*brca_metabric_clinical_data.tsv*.  The "tsv" suffix tells us that this file
contains information in tabular form in which values are separated by tab
characters so we'll use the **`read_tsv()`** to read these data.

```{r}
metabric <- read_tsv("data/brca_metabric_clinical_data.tsv")
```

`read_tsv()` prints a message telling us which types it has assigned to each of
the columns it has read, although in this case the table has quite a lot of
columns and it only outputs details about the first few.

If we print the clinical data set we can see that `read_tsv()` created a tibble.

```{r}
metabric
```

```{block type = "rmdblock"}
**`read_csv()`** and **`read_tsv()`**

`read_csv()` reads data from a comma-separated value (CSV) file into a tibble.
`read_tsv()` is the equivalent function that works on tab-delmited files.

These functions expect the first line to contain column names and try to make
sensible guesses at the type of data in each column. You can change this by
specifying various arguments, e.g. to skip comment lines beginning with a
specific character (e.g. "#") or to tell the function what the column types
are.

```

You can see that the column names are surrounded by back ticks. This is
because they contain characters, such as spaces and dashes, and in one case
starts with a number. R does not natively allow column names to contain special
characters other than "_" and "." or to start with numbers. There are ways
around this - using the back ticks - but this becomes cumbersome when writing
our code. To create clean column names we can use `clean_names()` from
`janitor` package.

```{r}
#install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
metabric <- clean_names(metabric)
```

We are now in a position to explore these data. For example, we can use the
**`table()`** function to count the number of patients in this cohort that had
chemotherapy and those that did not.

```{r}
table(metabric$chemotherapy)
```

We can summarize the numbers of mutations found per patient.

```{r}
summary(metabric$mutation_count)
```

## Working directory

When reading in the METABRIC dataset we specified the file using a relative
path, `data/brca_metabric_clinical_data.tsv`. This is relative to the current
working directory and is in the `data` subdirectory within our working
directory. The **`getwd()`** function will tell you what the current working
directory is.

```{r eval = FALSE}
getwd()
```

If you open RStudio by clicking on its icon in the task bar or its entry in the
start menu, your working directory will probably be your home folder.

You can specify a full path for the file you want to read, which is also known
as an absolute path.

You can explicitly set your working directory using **`setwd()`**.

If you're running an R script from a terminal window (by typing something like
`Rscript my_script.R` at the command prompt) your working directory will be the
directory in which you run the script (i.e. the one in which you issue the
Rscript command). In this case you will probably want to read files from
locations that are relative to the directory in which you run the script.

If you're writing an R script in RStudio you can set the working directory to be
the same directory as that which contains your script file using the menu:
**Session > Set Working Directory > To Source File Location**. You can also
navigate to the directory of your choosing in the Files tab pane and set this to
be the working directory by clicking on the **More** menu button and selecting
**Set As Working Directory**.

# Missing values

The METABRIC clinical dataset has some missing values. If you look back to the
table we printed out earlier you can see 2 missing values for mutation counts
within the first 10 rows.

```{r}
metabric$mutation_count[1:10]
```

```{block type = "rmdblock"}
**Missing values** (**`NA`**)

Missing values in R are represented as **`NA`**, which stands for 'not available'.
```

# Data manipulation with dplyr

**dplyr** is one of the packages that gets loaded as part of the tidyverse.

**dplyr** provides many useful functions for manipulating tabular data in data
frames or tibbles. We're going to look at the key functions for filtering our
data, modifying the contents and computing summary statistics.

We'll also introduce the pipe operator, **`%>%`**, for chaining operations
together into mini workflows in a way that makes for more readable and
maintainable code.

This time we'll use a METABRIC data set containing clinical data and gene
expression data to illustrate how these operations work.

```{r message = FALSE}
metabric <- read_csv("data/metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv")
metabric
```

# Data semantics

We use the terms 'observation' and 'variable' a lot in this course. As a
reminder from week 2, when we talk about an observation, we're talking about a
set of values measured for the same unit or thing, e.g. a person or a date, and
when we talk about a variable we are really talking about the attribute that we
are measuring or recording, e.g. height, temperature or expression value.

**Observations are represented as rows** in our data frames or tibbles, while
the **columns correspond to variables**.

```{block type = "rmdblock"}
From **"Tidy Data"** by **Hadley Wickham**, [*The Journal of Statistical
Software*, vol. 59, 2014](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf).

A data set is a collection of **values**, usually either numbers (if
quantitative) or character strings (if qualitative). Values are organised in
two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation.

A **variable** contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute
(like height, temperature, duration) across units.

An **observation** contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person
or a day) across attributes.
```



# dplyr verbs

We will be looking at the following key dplyr functions in this course:

* **`filter()`** for filtering rows
* **`select()`** for selecting columns
* **`arrange()`** for sorting rows
* **`mutate()`** for modifying columns or creating new ones
* **`summarise()`** for computing summary values

In looking at each of these in turn, we'll be applying these to the entire data
set. It is possible to combine these with the `group_by()` function to instead
operate on separate groups within our data set but this is something we'll cover
in detail later.

The dplyr operations are commonly referred to as "verbs" in a data manipulation
grammar. These verbs have a common syntax and work together in a consistent and
uniform manner. They all have the following shared behaviours:

* The first argument in each function is a data frame (or tibble)

* Any additional arguments describe what operation to perform on the data frame

* Variable names, i.e. column names, are referred to without using quotes

* The result of an operation is a new data frame

# Filtering rows with `filter()`

The **`filter`** verb allows you to choose rows from a data frame that match
some specified criteria. The criteria are based on values of variables and can
make use of comparison operators such as `==`, `>`, `<` and `!=`.

For example, to filter the METABRIC data set so that it only contains
observations for those patients who died of breast cancer we can use `filter()`
as follows.

```{r}
deceased <- filter(metabric, Vital_status == "Died of Disease")
deceased
```

Remember that the **`==`** operator tests for equality, i.e. is the value for
`Vital_status` for each patient (observation) equal to "Died of Disease".

This filtering operation is equivalent to subsetting the rows based on a logical
vector resulting from our comparison of vital status values with "Died of
Disease".

```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(metabric, Vital_status == "Died of Disease")
# is equivalent to
metabric[metabric$Vital_status == "Died of Disease", ]
```

Both achieve the same result but the dplyr filter method is arguably a little
easier to read. We haven't had to write `metabric` twice for one thing; we just
referred to the variable name as it is, unquoted and without any fuss.

Let's have a look at the various categories in the `Vital_status` variable.

```{r}
table(metabric$Vital_status)
```

We could use the `!=` comparison operator to select all deceased patients
regardless of whether they died of the disease or other causes, by filtering for
those that don't have the value "Living".

```{r}
deceased <- filter(metabric, Vital_status != "Living")
nrow(deceased)
```

Another way of doing this is to specify which classes we are interested in and
use the **`%in%`** operator to test which observations (rows) contain those
values.

```{r}
deceased <- filter(metabric,
                   Vital_status %in% c("Died of Disease", "Died of Other Causes"))
nrow(deceased)
```

Another of the tidyverse packages, **`stringr`**, contains a set of very useful
functions for operating on text or character strings. One such function,
**`str_starts()`** could be used to find all `Vital_status` values that start
with "Died".

```{r}
deceased <- filter(metabric, str_starts(Vital_status, "Died"))
nrow(deceased)
```

Note that `str_starts()` returns a logical vector - this is important since the
filtering condition must evaluate to `TRUE` or `FALSE` values for each row.

Unsurprisingly there is an equivalent function, `str_ends()`, for matching the
end of text (character) values and `str_detect()` is another useful function
that determines whether values match a regular expression. Regular expressions
are a language for search patterns used frequently in computer programming and
really worth getting to grips with but sadly these are beyond the scope of this
course.

Filtering based on a logical variable is the most simple type of filtering of
all. We don't have any logical variables in our METABRIC data set so we'll
create one from the binary `Survival_status` variable to use as an example.

```{r}
# create a new logical variable called 'Deceased'
metabric$Deceased <- metabric$Survival_status == "DECEASED"
#
# filtering based on a logical variable - only selects TRUE values
deceased <- filter(metabric, Deceased)
#
# only display those columns we're interested in
deceased[, c("Patient_ID", "Survival_status", "Vital_status", "Deceased")]
```

We can use the **`!`** operator to filter those patients who are not
deceased.

```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(metabric, !Deceased)
```

The eagle-eyed will have spotted that filtering on our newly created Deceased
logical variable gave a slightly different number of observations (patients) who
are considered to be deceased, compared with the filtering operations shown
above based on the `Vital_status` variable. We get one extra row. This is
because we have a missing value for the vital status of one of the patients. We
can filter for this using the **`is.na()`** function.

```{r}
missing_vital_status <- filter(metabric, is.na(Vital_status))
missing_vital_status[, c("Patient_ID",
                         "Survival_status",
                         "Vital_status",
                         "Deceased")]
```

`filter()` only retains rows where the condition if `TRUE`; both `FALSE` and
`NA` values are filtered out.

We can apply more than one condition in our filtering operation, for example
the patients who were still alive at the time of the METABRIC study and had
survived for more than 10 years (120 months).

```{r}
filter(metabric, Survival_status == "LIVING", Survival_time > 120)
```

The equivalent using R's usual subsetting is slightly less readable.

```{r eval = FALSE}
metabric[metabric$Survival_status == "LIVING" & metabric$Survival_time > 120, ]
```

We can add as many conditions as we like separating each with a comma. Note that
filtering using R subsetting gets more unreadable, and more cumbersome to code,
the more conditions you add.

Adding conditions in this way is equivalent to combining the conditions using
the **`&`** (Boolean AND) operator.

```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(metabric, Survival_status == "LIVING", Survival_time > 120)
```

Naturally we can also check when either of two conditions holds true by using
the **`|`** (Boolean OR) operator. And we can build up more complicated
filtering operations using both `&` and `|`. For example, let's see which
patients have stage 3 or stage 4 tumours that are either estrogen receptor (ER)
positive or progesterone receptor (PR) positive.

```{r}
selected_patients <- filter(metabric,
                            Tumour_stage >= 3,
                            ER_status == "Positive" | PR_status == "Positive")
nrow(selected_patients)
```

In this case, if you used `&` in place of the comma you'd need to be careful
about the precedence of the `&` and `|` operators and use parentheses to make
clear what you intended.

```{r eval = FALSE}
filter(metabric, Tumour_stage >= 3 &
           (ER_status == "Positive" | PR_status == "Positive"))
```



# Selecting columns with `select()`

Another way of "slicing and dicing"" our tabular data set is to select just the
variables or columns we're interested in. This can be important particularly
when the data set contains a very large number of variables as is the case for
the METABRIC data. Notice how when we print the METABRIC data frame it is not
possible to display all the columns; we only get the first few and then a long
list of the additional ones that weren't displayed.

Using the `$` operator is quite convenient for selecting a single column and
extracting the values as a vector. Selecting several columns using the `[]`
subsetting operator is a bit more cumbersome. For example, in our look at
filtering rows, we considered two different variables in our data set that
are concerned with the living/deceased status of patients. When printing out
the results we selected just those columns along with the patient identifier
and the newly created `Deceased` column.

```{r}
deceased[, c("Patient_ID", "Survival_status", "Vital_status", "Deceased")]
```

The **`select()`** function from dplyr is simpler.

```{r}
select(metabric, Patient_ID, Survival_status, Vital_status, Deceased)
```

Notice the similarities with the `filter()` function. The first argument is the
data frame we are operating on and the arguments that follow on are specific to
the operation in question, in this case, the variables (columns) to select. Note
that the variables do not need to be put in quotes, and the returned value is
another data frame, even if only one column was selected.

We can alter the order of the variables (columns).

```{r}
select(metabric, Patient_ID, Vital_status, Survival_status, Deceased)
```

We can also select a range of columns using **`:`**, e.g. to select the patient
identifier and all the columns between `Tumour_size` and `Cancer_type` we could
run the following `select()` command.

```{r}
select(metabric, Patient_ID, Chemotherapy:Tumour_stage)
```

The help page for `select` points to some special functions that can be used
within `select()`. We can find all the columns, for example, that contain the
term "status" using `contains()`.

```{r}
select(metabric, contains("status"))
```

If we only wanted those ending with "status" we could use `ends_with()`
instead.

```{r}
select(metabric, ends_with("status"))
```

We can also select those columns we're not interested in and that shouldn't be
included by prefixing the columns with **`-`**.

```{r}
select(metabric, -Cohort)
```

You can use a combination of explicit naming, ranges, helper functions and
negation to select the columns of interest.

```{r}
selected_columns <- select(metabric,
                           Patient_ID,
                           starts_with("Tumour_"),
                           `3-gene_classifier`:Integrative_cluster,
                           -Cellularity)
selected_columns
```

You can also use `select()` to completely reorder the columns so they're in the
order of your choosing. The `everything()` helper function is useful in this
context, particularly if what you're really interested in is bringing one or
more columns to the left hand side and then including everything else
afterwards in whatever order they were already in.

```{r}
select(metabric, Patient_ID, Survival_status, Tumour_stage, everything())
```

Note dplyr also provides the `relocate()` function to achieve the same goal:

```{r}
relocate(metabric, Patient_ID, Survival_status, Tumour_stage)
```

Finally, columns can be renamed as part of the selection process.

```{r}
select(metabric,
       Patient_ID, Classification = `3-gene_classifier`,
       NPI = Nottingham_prognostic_index)
```

Note that dplyr provides the `rename()` function for when we only want to rename
a column and not select a subset of columns.

```{r}
rename(metabric, PatientID = Patient_ID)
```

# Sorting using `arrange()`

It is sometimes quite useful to sort our data frame based on the values in one
or more of the columns, particularly when displaying the contents or saving them
to a file. The `arrange()` function in dplyr provides this sorting capability.

For example, we can sort the METABRIC patients into order of increasing
survival time.

```{r}
arrange(metabric, Survival_time)
```

Or we might be more interested in the patients that survived the longest so
would need the order to be of decreasing survival time. For that we can use
the helper function `desc()` that works specifically with `arrange()`.

```{r}
arrange(metabric, desc(Survival_time))
```

We can sort by more than one variable by adding more variable arguments to
`arrange()`.

```{r}
arrange(metabric, Tumour_stage, Nottingham_prognostic_index)
```

Here we've sorted first by tumour stage from lowest to highest value and then
by the Nottingham prognostic index for when there are ties, i.e. where the
tumour stage is the same.

Sorting is most commonly used in workflows as one of the last steps before
printing out a data frame or writing out the table to a file.


# Reading data from Excel files into R

We haven't yet showed how to read Excel spreadsheets into R. There are several
packages providing this capability, but for general use the `readxl` package
from the tidyverse ideal.

`readxl` should have been installed as part of the tidyverse but if you find
that's not the case, you will have to install it separately.

`readxl` is not loaded as one of the core tidyverse packages when you run
`library(tidyverse)` so you'll have to load this separately.

The the main functions are `read_excel`, `read_xls` and `read_xslx`. Use
`?read_xls` to find out how specify cell ranges and worksheets to be read.
